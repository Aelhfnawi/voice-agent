The challenge: Gemini Live API is still in beta and complex. Let me check the current API and create a working implementation.
Two approaches:
Approach A: Full Gemini Live (Complex)

Real speech-to-speech streaming
Requires beta API access
~2-3 hours

Approach B: Hybrid Solution (Practical)

Use Gemini STT (speech-to-text)
RAG retrieval
Gemini TTS (text-to-speech)
Works NOW with your current API
~30-45 minutes

I recommend Approach B - it will work immediately and demonstrate the complete system.
The flow will be:

User speaks → STT converts to text
Text → RAG retrieves context
Text + Context → Gemini generates answer
Answer → TTS converts to speech
Speech → User hears response

Sound good? Let's implement Approach B 🚀
